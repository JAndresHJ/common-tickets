# Common Module
This module was created with the aim of sharing and reuse code between the microservices created at the https://github.com/JAndresHJ/microservies-react-node project.

We have written a common module (npm package) that includes all errors and common middlewares and also all the events that the services communicate with. But this solution is only feasible if all the services are written in typescript.

# Install
```
npm install @jandrestickets/common
```
